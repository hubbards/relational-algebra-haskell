-- | This module contains a complete example for the extension of relational
--   algebra.
--
--   Suppose that a store sells computers assembled from used parts. The store
--   has a database for the inventory of used parts. In the database, there is
--   a relation for memory cards and a relation for motherboards with two used
--   memory slots.

-- | Which computers can be assembled from the memory cards and motherboards so
--   that three memory slots are used by at most two slot types?
--
--   Assume that a motherboard has a free slot of a given type if a slot of that
--   type is already being used. Also, assume that memory cards already in a
--   motherboard can't be removed.
